# Avalanche-Prediction
Disclaimer: We don't own the datasets we intend to use as they come under public domain.
Avalanches are not the first thing you'd think of when hearing the term "natural disasters" and that's why there hasn't been as extensive technological implementation to avalanches as there have been to other more commonly known natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. Avalanches are very under-represented in this regard and we hope to change that.
We plan to use the dataset of snow-covered avalanche prone areas and correlate certain properties of the area to the probability of an avalanche occurring.
Our aim is to create a probabilistic model of an avalanche occurring in a mountainous area using data like rainfall, snowfall, mountain steepness, temperature, liquid amount in snow and a few more properties if provided in the datasets. 
We have decided to use different classifiers in Python, we desire to predict the occurrence of an avalanche as best as possible so that necessary precautions can be taken by alerting the required authorities.
